# movie-repository-go-mongo-dao-rest

This is a project which integrates rest apis to perform CRUD operations on any database.

Features:
- REST api endpoints
- REST endpoint routers and controllers
- DAO pattern to instantiate database

Currently as an example this uses mongoDb but can easily be configured to use any other database
